# 🛒 Online Retail Sales Analysis (2009–2010)
  
Covers everything from **data cleaning** to **customer segmentation (RFM)** and **sales forecasting**.  

---

## 🔑 What’s Inside
✔️ Cleaned 500k+ transaction records (removed BOM, handled missing values & returns)  
✔️ Analyzed top-selling products, countries, and monthly sales patterns  
✔️ Measured **revenue lost to returns** (~£630K, ~6.1%)  
✔️ Built **RFM segmentation** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for customer insights  
✔️ Forecasted short-term sales using **SARIMA time-series models**  
✔️ Interactive visualizations with **Plotly**

## 📊 Key Insights
- UK dominates sales (~90%+ revenue) → skewed global view  
- Seasonal spikes: strong holiday sales, weak summer months  
- Small % of customers drive most revenue (Pareto principle holds true)  
- Returns significantly affect net revenue  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset covers **only 1 year** (2009–2010)  
- Missing ~20% of customer IDs → incomplete segmentation  
- No marketing/cost data → can’t analyze profitability  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Extend to multi-year datasets for stronger forecasting  
- Add **CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)** and churn prediction  
- Apply **Market Basket Analysis** for cross-sell/upsell opportunities  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Statsmodels)  
- Jupyter Notebook
